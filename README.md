# Welcome to the Computerized Vehicles Github!

This project was commissioned by Leveloper on the Minecraft Computer Mods discord.
It currently adds CC: Tweaked integration for Immersive Vehicles! (This may expand to cover other computer mods as well!)

Currently, this mod is primarily of use for server owners and pack developers as its new `vehicles` API is only available to Command Computers!
